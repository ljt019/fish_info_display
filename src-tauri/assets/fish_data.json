    "average_size": "2 to 5 feet",
    "average_weight": "5 to 30 pounds",
    "average_lifespan": "3 to 8 years",
    "habitat": "North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, rivers, and streams during spawning",
    "diet": "Carnivorous, feeding on insects, zooplankton, crustaceans, and smaller fish",
    "blurb": "Salmon are anadromous fish, meaning they live in both fresh and saltwater at different stages of their lives. Born in freshwater rivers and streams, they migrate to the ocean to mature before returning to their birthplace to spawn. Known for their rich flavor and high nutritional value, salmon are popular in both commercial and recreational fishing industries. They play a vital role in their ecosystems, supporting other species such as bears, eagles, and humans. Some salmon species can travel hundreds of miles and overcome significant obstacles to reach their spawning grounds, demonstrating remarkable endurance and navigational skills.",

    "average_lifespan": "25 to 30 years",
    "habitat": "Deep, cold waters of the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans",

    "blurb": "The Greenland halibut, also known as the Greenland turbot, is a deep-sea flatfish found in the frigid waters of the Arctic and North Atlantic. Unlike the Pacific halibut, this species lives at great depths, often between 600 and 2,000 feet. Its diet consists primarily of fish, squid, and crustaceans. Greenland halibut have a distinctive appearance, with their top side being dark and their underside pale, blending well with the ocean floor. They are a significant commercial species in Arctic fisheries and play a vital role in the ecosystem as a predator.",

    "blurb": "The Arctic cod, also known as polar cod, is a small, silvery fish found in the cold, deep waters of the Arctic Ocean. They play a crucial role in the Arctic food web, serving as a primary food source for larger predators such as seals, whales, and seabirds. Arctic cod are known for their ability to survive in extreme cold temperatures and low light conditions. They have antifreeze proteins in their blood that prevent ice crystals from forming and damaging their cells. Arctic cod are an essential species in the Arctic ecosystem, supporting a diverse range of predators and contributing to the overall health of the marine environment.",

    "blurb": "The Antarctic toothfish, also known as the Chilean sea bass, is a large predatory fish found in the cold waters of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. They are known for their long lifespan, slow growth rate, and high oil content, making them a valuable commercial species. Antarctic toothfish have a unique adaptation called cryopelagic drift, where they release buoyant eggs that drift with the currents to hatch in more favorable conditions. This strategy allows them to reproduce in the harsh Antarctic environment. Antarctic toothfish play a vital role in the Antarctic ecosystem as top predators, controlling the populations of smaller fish and squid.",

They are known for their unique adaptation to the extreme cold temperatures of the Antarctic environment. Antarctic spiny icefish lack red blood cells and hemoglobin, which are typically used to transport oxygen in most vertebrates. Instead, they have a specialized protein that binds to oxygen and allows them to survive in oxygen-poor waters. Antarctic spiny icefish play a crucial role in the Antarctic food web, serving as prey for larger predators such as seals, whales, and seabirds.",
